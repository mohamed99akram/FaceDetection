- X is copied multiple times in classifier.py, so it is better to make it a global variable??
- Pass exact needed feature for each image instead of all features for each image
  - This needs to be different in `classifier.py` than in `strong_classifier.py`, than in `cascade.py`
- How to make processing features in batches, each batch from a different file?
- strong classifier should only return chosen classifiers, without the dataset
