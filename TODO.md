- Training
  - [ ] X is copied multiple times in classifier.py (X.type(float32)), so it is better to make it a global variable?? [x] done in cascade, but not in classifier
  - [ ] Build architecture like the paper to deduce T, layers count
  - [x] Train a hard dataset
  - [ ] How to make processing features in batches, each batch from a different file?
  - [ ] Implement f value on GPU (chosing 10%)
  - [x] train 24x24 without percentile
  - [ ] try removing outliers?
  - [x] Train with Adaboost from sklearn
  - [ ] adaboost with decision tree instead of stump
  - [ ] Train full cascade
  - [ ] torch.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier
  - [ ] cuML
  - [ ] increase percentage of nonfaces (5 times number of faces?)
  - [ ] Get data from gdown if colab instead of manually copying it 
--------------
- Testing
  - [x] Test using chosen features only 
    - [x] Pass exact needed feature for each image instead of all features for each image
      - [x] This needs to be different in `classifier.py` than in `strong_classifier.py`, than in `cascade.py`
      - [x] Optimize it
  - [x] Detect face in a general image (subwindows, scaling)
  - [ ] Detect faces in a video
  - [x] Normalize faces? (μ, σ)
  - [ ] Delete `Please Call chooseClassifier() first` warning?
  - [ ] make inference faster using paper's method
  - [x] test on multiple faces in the same image
  - [ ] Play with threshold of the classifier to minimize false positives
  - [x] remove dictionaries, they seem to be slow
  - [x] memoize what you can in `feature_extractor.py`
  - [ ] `getChosenIndecies` needs to be optimized?
  - [x] `_idx2f_desc()` seems useful, (memoize? embedded systems?)
  - [ ] try to edit cascade.py to train one strong classifier and use parts of it in differnt layers
      - (if an image is not a face by using 3 weak classifiers, then it is still not a face using 200?)
  - [ ] resize image itself by scale factor rather than resizing each subwindow.
  - [ ] merge subwindows that are close to each other (IoU)
